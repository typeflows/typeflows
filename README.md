# Typeflows - Type-safe GitHub configuration as code

## Overview

Typeflows is a type-safe GitHub configuration platform that replaces manual GitHub management with programmable, testable, and shareable code. You can use Typeflows to manage your entire `.github/` folder - workflows, security policies, branch protection, and more. This repository contains project examples demonstrating how to use Typeflows across different programming languages and build systems.

Stop copy-pasting configurations between repositories and start treating your GitHub setup as infrastructure!
